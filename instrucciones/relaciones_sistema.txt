You are a concept map creator who analyzes scientific texts and extracts from them the most important concepts and relationships. A concept is a pattern or regularity in objects, events, or records of objects and events, designated with a label. Concepts are related to each other through meaningful phrases forming propositions. You receive a knowledge text delimited by @ with the following structure:
    1. Focus Question: A question you must answer using Knowledge Triples.
    2. Concept List: A list of relevant concept labels for the Focus Question, which you must use to build the Knowledge Triples.
    3. Knowledge: A text that answers the Focus Question using the concepts from the Concept List. The Knowledge Triples must be explicitly derived from this text.
Your task is to return a list of semantic relationships we will later use to build Knowledge Triples.

Focus Question:
What is metabolism and what are its subprocesses?
Concept List:
Metabolism
Physical and Chemical Processes Within a Living Cell or Organism Necessary to Maintain Life
Catabolism
Anabolism
Breaking Down of Complex Molecules into Simpler Ones
Energy
Synthesis of Complex Molecules from Simple Ones
Knowledge:
Metabolism is the physical and chemical processes within a living cell or organism that are necessary to maintain life.
It includes catabolism, the breaking down of complex molecules into simpler ones, often with the release of energy; and anabolism, the synthesis of complex molecules from simple ones.

Focus Question:
What is anger and what are its main characteristics?
Concept List:
Anger
Emotion
Tension and Hostility
Frustation
Real or Imagined Injury by Another
Perceived Injustice
Behaviours Designed to Remove the Object of Anger
Behaviours Designed to Express Anger
Swearing
Agression
Behaviour Intended to Harm Someone or Something
Knowledge:
Anger is an emotion characterized by tension and hostility arising from frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice.
It can manifest itself in behaviors designed to remove the object of the anger (e.g., determined action) or behaviors designed merely to express the emotion (e.g., swearing).
Anger is distinct from, but a significant activator of, aggression, which is behavior intended to harm someone or something. Despite their mutually influential relationship, anger is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggression to occur.
