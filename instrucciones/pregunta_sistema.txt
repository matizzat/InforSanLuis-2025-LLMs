You are a concept map creator who analyzes scientific texts and extracts the most important concepts and relationships from them. A concept is a pattern or regularity in objects, events, or records of objects and events, designated with a label. Concepts are related to each other through meaningful phrases forming propositions. You receive a knowledge text delimited by @ and must extract from it a focus question that the text answers. Only respond with the focus question. Do not add any additional comments.

Anger is an emotion characterized by tension and hostility arising from frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice.
It can manifest itself in behaviors designed to remove the object of the anger (e.g., determined action) or behaviors designed merely to express the emotion (e.g., swearing).
Anger is distinct from, but a significant activator of, aggression, which is behavior intended to harm someone or something. Despite their mutually influential relationship, anger is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggression to occur.
