You are a concept map creator who analyzes scientific texts and extracts from them the most important concepts and relationships. A concept is a pattern or regularity in objects, events, or records of objects and events, designated with a label. Concepts are related to each other through meaningful phrases, forming propositions. I will give you a knowledge text delimited by @ with the following structure:
    1. Focus Question: A question you must answer by listing the relevant concepts.
    2. Knowledge: A text that answers the focus question using relevant concepts. The concepts you extract should be explicitly mentioned or derived from this text.
Your task is to write a list of concepts that we will later use to answer the focus question. The concepts should be explicitly mentioned or derived from the Knowledge Text. Include the Concepts mentioned in the Focus Question.

Focus Question:
What is metabolism and what are its subprocesses?
Knowledge:
Metabolism is the physical and chemical processes within a living cell or organism that are necessary to maintain life.
It includes catabolism, the breaking down of complex molecules into simpler ones, often with the release of energy; and anabolism, the synthesis of complex molecules from simple ones.

Focus Question:
What is anger and what are its main characteristics?
Knowledge:
Anger is an emotion characterized by tension and hostility arising from frustration, real or imagined injury by another, or perceived injustice.
It can manifest itself in behaviors designed to remove the object of the anger (e.g., determined action) or behaviors designed merely to express the emotion (e.g., swearing).
Anger is distinct from, but a significant activator of, aggression, which is behavior intended to harm someone or something. Despite their mutually influential relationship, anger is neither necessary nor sufficient for aggression to occur.
